       "Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs’ intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the s"

       "approaches in their respective contexts, and speculate on upcoming trends and innovations. Our contributions are as follows: In this survey, we present a thorough and systematic review of the state-of-the-art RAG methods, delineating its evolution through paradigms including naive RAG, advanced RAG, and modular RAG. This review contextualizes the broader scope of RAG research within the landscape of LLMs. We identify and discuss the central technologies integral to the RAG process, specifically focusing on the aspects of “Retrieval”, “Generation” and “Augmentation”, and delve into their synergies, elucidating how these components intricately collaborate to form a cohesive and effective RAG framework. We have summarized the current assessment methods of RAG, covering 26 tasks, nearly 50 datasets, outlining the evaluation objectives and metrics, as well as the current evaluation benchmarks and tools. Additionally, we anticipate future directions for RAG, emphasizing potential enhancements to tackle current challenges. The paper unfolds as follows: SectionIIintroduces the main concept and current paradigms of RAG. The following three sections explore core components—“Retrieval”, “Generation” and “Augmentation”, respectively. SectionIIIfocuses on optimization methods in retrieval,including indexing, query and embedding optimization. SectionIVconcentrates on post-retrieval process and LLM fine-tuning in generation. SectionVanalyzes the three augmentation processes. SectionVIfocuses on RAG’s downstream tasks and evaluation system. SectionVIImainly discusses the challenges that RAG currently faces and its future development directions. At last, the paper concludes in SectionVIII. IIOverview of RAG A typical application of RAG is illustrated in Figure2. Here, a user poses a question to ChatGPT about a recent, widely discussed news. Given ChatGPT’s reliance on pre-training data, it initially lacks the capacity to provide updates on recent developments. RAG bridges this information gap by sourcing and incorporating knowledge"
