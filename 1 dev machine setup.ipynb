    "## .env File Setup\n",
    "We will use OpenAI embeddings, GPT3.5, and Weaviate Cloud Services vector database for this tutorial, so you will need to securely store your API keys in a `.env` file. This file is in `.gitignore` so it doesn't accidentally get committed to the repo where your keys would be exposed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in the root of the repo from this template:  \n",

    "# Test Your Environment\n",
    "Open `./cheat-code/query_qa_rag_agent.ipynb` in VSCode. Click \"Run All\" and select the `venv` python environment if prompted. The notebook should display a GPT3.5 completion to the question about the paper. If you get an error, try to diagnose it or flag one of us for help."
